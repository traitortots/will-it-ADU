            <p class="story-text"><span>In order to create the maps and descriptive statistics for this project, the data sets mentioned above were analyzed using Python, specifically the GeoPandas and Shapely libraries, in a Jupyter Notebook environment. To find tax parcels suitable for the development of ADUs, each municipalities tax parcels were read into a GeoPandas dataframe, clipped with building footprints, and analyzed using topological set-theoretic relationships and affine transformations to determine whether the remaining space in a tax parcel is sufficient to allow for the construction of an ADU. A full outline of the analysis strategy can be found in the project&rsquo;s </span><span ><a href="https://github.com/traitortots/will-it-ADU&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1669744274434200&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Qlh_ChyUij5VxvKVpoLGu">GitHub repository</a></span><span>. </span></p>
            <p class="story-text"><span>After this initial physical analysis is complete, a variety of other limiting factors and important pieces of context were analyzed. These include a variety of legal barriers in the form of zoning regulations (owner-occupancy requirements, minimum lot size requirements, detached ADU bans, etc), financial barriers, awareness, and interest/willingness from potential host properties. </span></p>
            
            <p class="story-text"><span>We believe that this project reveals an untapped potential for neighborhood densification through the targeted development of accessory dwelling units in Ithaca, New York, and New Haven, Connecticut, which would show that ADUs are a viable way to address the housing crisis in these two cities while remaining sensitive to neighborhood context and alleviating common complains about the production of new housing in communities. This project also shows the various layers of bureaucracy and technical considerations faced by those who would like to build ADUs on their properties and/or communities.</span></p></div>
